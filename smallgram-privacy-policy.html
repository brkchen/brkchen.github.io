    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: December 07, 2025</p>

    <p>Smallgram for Telegram (&ldquo;Smallgram&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) is committed to protecting your privacy while keeping the app reliable. This policy explains what we do&mdash;and do not&mdash;collect when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. What we <strong>never</strong> collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Telegram account credentials, contacts, or profile details</li>
        <li>Chat messages, media, call history, or any other conversation content</li>
        <li>Payment information, government IDs, or precise location data</li>
        <li>Your home or mailing address, email address, phone number, or other contact details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These items stay on your device or with Telegram. They are never uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash diagnostics</strong> &ndash; anonymised stack traces, app version, device model, OS build, and memory or storage status at the moment of a crash so we can find and fix issues quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal usage analytics</strong> &ndash; non-identifying counters such as &ldquo;video playback started&rdquo;, feature flags, and coarse timestamps that tell us which parts of the app need improvements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We intentionally exclude chat identifiers, phone numbers, IP addresses, advertising IDs, or any data that could uniquely identify you on its own.</p>

    <h2>3. How we use the data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Maintain stability</strong> &ndash; troubleshoot crashes, measure app performance, secure the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve the product</strong> &ndash; prioritise fixes, plan features, and understand generic usage trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Comply with law</strong> &ndash; honour valid legal requests, enforce our terms, and prevent abuse.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell data, build advertising profiles, or attempt to re-identify users.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing and processing</h2>
    <p>We rely on trusted processors such as Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics to collect diagnostics on our behalf. Each processor is bound by contractual safeguards, handles data only under our instructions, and adheres to industry security standards. We may disclose data if required by applicable law or to defend our legal rights.</p>

    <h2>5. Storage, retention, and security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Crash and usage logs are stored in encrypted form in Google Cloud regions appropriate for the app store you download from.</li>
        <li>Raw crash reports are typically retained for up to 13 months; aggregated statistics may be kept longer for trend analysis.</li>
        <li>Access is limited to personnel who need the data to operate or improve Smallgram, and we regularly review permissions, logging, and deletion routines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your controls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can disable analytics and crash sharing at the operating-system level (for example, through Android settings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect product or regulatory changes. The &ldquo;Last updated&rdquo; date will always show the most recent revision. Material changes will be highlighted inside the app or release notes.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about privacy can be sent to <span class="contact">brkchen@icloud.com</span>. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe and help you exercise any rights provided by your local privacy laws.</p>
