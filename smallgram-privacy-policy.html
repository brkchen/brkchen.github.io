    <p class="meta">Last updated: December 10, 2025</p>

    <p>Smallgram for Telegram (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;) is a third-party client that allows you to access your Telegram account on supported devices. Smallgram is not an official Telegram product and is not affiliated with Telegram FZ-LLC.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses, how it is used, and what choices you have. By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Device and usage data (Firebase)</h3>
    <p>To maintain and improve the stability and performance of the App, we use Google Firebase services, including but not limited to Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics (or Google Analytics for Firebase). These services may automatically collect certain information, such as:</p>

        <li>Events related to how you use the App (for example, screens opened, button taps, session duration)</li>
        <li>Crash and error information (for example, stack traces, device state at the time of crash)</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Diagnose crashes and technical issues</li>
        <li>Understand how features are used</li>
        <li>Improve the stability, performance, and user experience of the App</li>
